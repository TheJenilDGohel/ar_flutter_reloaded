## Setting up Google Cloud Anchor Service

The **Google Cloud Anchor API** is essential for uploading, storing, and downloading AR anchors. If your app uses collaborative AR features, complete the following setup:

### 1. Activate the Cloud Anchor API
- Go to the [Cloud Anchor API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/arcorecloudanchor.googleapis.com) page.
- Enable the API in your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) for your project.

### 2. Register the Android Part of Your Flutter Application

#### Steps for OAuth 2.0 Setup:
1. Open the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
3. Click **Create Credentials > OAuth client ID** and select **Android** as the Application type.
4. Enter:
    - **Name**: A descriptive name for your app.
    - **Package name**: This must match the package name in your `AndroidManifest.xml`.
    - **SHA-1 Certificate Fingerprint**: Run this command in your terminal:
      ```
      keytool -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -list -v
      ```
5. Click **Create Client ID**.
6. If required, configure the **OAuth Consent Screen**:
    - Go to the [OAuth Consent Screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) page.
    - Fill in details such as product name and support email.
    - Add required scopes, including `ARCore Cloud Anchor API`.

#### Keyless Authentication Setup:
1. Add the dependency in `android/app/build.gradle`:
   ```gradle
   implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth:16+'
   ```
2. If using **ProGuard**, update `build.gradle`:
   ```gradle
   buildTypes {
       release {
           proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
       }
   }
   ```
3. Add these rules to `proguard-rules.pro`:
   ```proguard
   -keep class com.google.android.gms.common.** { *; }
   -keep class com.google.android.gms.auth.** { *; }
   -keep class com.google.android.gms.tasks.** { *; }
   ```

### 3. Register the iOS Part of Your Flutter Application

#### Steps for Google Service Account Setup:
1. Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
2. Create a **Service Account**:
    - Fill in a name and assign the role **Service Account Token Creator**.
    - Create and download the JSON private key file.
3. Add the JSON file to your Flutter project:
    - Rename it to `cloudAnchorKey.json`.
    - Move it to `example/ios/Runner`.
    - Open Xcode and add the file to the Runner target.

## Setting up Firebase (Optional)

If using **Firebase** for managing cloud anchors:
1. Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
2. Register your app for Android and iOS:
    - Download the `google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist` files, and place them in the respective directories (`android/app` and `ios/Runner`).
3. Update your Android `build.gradle` files:
    - Add:
      ```gradle
      classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.3'
      ```
    - Apply the plugin:
      ```gradle
      apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
      ```
4. Enable **Cloud Firestore** in the Firebase Console.

## Setting up Location Services

To enable location-based AR features:
1. Add the following to your `Info.plist` file for iOS:
   ```xml
   <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app needs access to location when open.</string>
   <key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app needs access to location when in the background.</string>
   ```
