Additional Notes:
This project, ar_flutter_reloaded, is heavily inspired by the original ar_flutter_plugin authored by Lars Carius. While the codebase has been restructured and upgraded to work with the latest Flutter and Android libraries, it maintains a deep respect for the original work.

The updates and enhancements are intended to build upon the solid foundation established by ar_flutter_plugin while continuing to serve the Flutter and AR communities.

If any aspect of this project appears to conflict with the original license or the author's intentions, it is unintentional. Please feel free to contact me so that it can be resolved promptly and amicably.
