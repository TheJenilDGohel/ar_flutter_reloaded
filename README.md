# ar_flutter_reloaded
[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/ar_flutter_reloaded.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/ar_flutter_reloaded)

Flutter Plugin for creating **collaborative Augmented Reality (AR)** experiences, supporting **ARKit** for iOS and **ARCore** for Android devices.

This plugin is a reimagined and enhanced version of the original **ar_flutter_plugin** by Lars Carius. Huge thanks to **Oleksandr Leuschenko** for the [arkit_flutter_plugin](https://github.com/olexale/arkit_flutter_plugin) and **Gian Marco Di Francesco** for the [arcore_flutter_plugin](https://github.com/giandifra/arcore_flutter_plugin), whose work laid the foundation for AR in Flutter. Gratitude also to **Lars Carius**, whose exceptional work inspired this reloaded version.

## Getting Started

### Installing
Add the plugin to your Flutter project by running:
```bash
flutter pub add ar_flutter_reloaded
```  

Or manually add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yaml
dependencies:
  ar_flutter_reloaded: ^0.0.1
```  

Then, fetch the package using:
```bash
flutter pub get
```  

---

### Importing

Add this import to your Dart code:
```dart
import 'package:ar_flutter_reloaded/ar_flutter_plugin.dart';
```  

If you encounter issues with permissions on iOS, especially with the camera view, add the following to your `Podfile`:
```pod
post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    flutter_additional_ios_build_settings(target)
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings['GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS'] ||= [
        '$(inherited)',
        'PERMISSION_CAMERA=1',
        'PERMISSION_LOCATION=1',
        # Add other required permissions here
      ]
    end
  end
end
```
